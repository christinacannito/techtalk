		<h2>Let's begin</h2>
		<p>Before we start typing a line of code we will cover a few basic topics.</p>
		<p>Here are some keywords that you should start to become firmilar with.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Text editor:
				<ul>
					<li>You need to write your code in a text editor</li>
					<li>The default text editor for window is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B" target="_blank">Notepad++</a></li>
					<li>The default text editor for mac is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit" target="_blank">Textedit</a></li>
					<li>You can also download and install <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Syntax - </li>
			<li>Frontend - </li>
			<li>Backend - </li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you want to continue to build website then you should take the time to install either Sublime Text or another text editor you really like. A text editor like Sublime Text has many great features that the default text editors don't offer. (Such as syntax highlighting and autocompletion.)</p>

		<h2>Communication</h2>
		<p>We are going to focus on frontend development. There are two languages we are going to focus on for frontend development.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a> - Hyper Text Markup Language. This will be used for the layout of our site, providing layout and structure. </li>
			<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a> - Cascading Style Sheet. This will add the styles to our site. Using CSS you can adjust the colors, fonts, images, adjust the widths and heights of elements and so much much. (With CSS3 you can even do animations!)</li>
			<!-- <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> - </li> -->
		</ul>
		<p>With these two languages we are going to create our website!</p>
		<p>*JavaScript is another language used in frontend developement, but we can cover that language in part two :)</p>

			<h2>Taking a look at what we will be building <span><i class="fa fa-binoculars" aria-hidden="true"></i></span></h2>
			<img src="images/sample_page_sm.jpg" width="" height="" alt="completed sample page thumbnail">
			<p>This might look very complicated, but we will work on each section of this site one at a time.</p>
		</article>	

		<article class="startFiles">
			<h2>Starter files</h2>
			<p>Since we are going to try to have everyone get a site up in one hour I am going to give you some starter files and folders. You can download the starter files here at my <a href="https://github.com/christinacannito/talkstarterfiles" target="_blank">github</a> account.</p>
			<p>Once you have downloaded the files you will unzip them and place them on your desktop. Once they are saved on your desktop you will drag the entire folder onto your text editor. </p>
			<img src="images/step_01.png" alt="step 1 opening the sample folders and files"> 
			<p>This is what you should see when you drag the folder into your text editor. Now if you click on the index.htm file you will see there is some code already there to help you get started. </p>
			<img src="images/step_02.png" width="300" height="100" alt="step 2 looking at the index file">
			<p>What is written in this file can be thought of as the structure of our site.</p>
		</article>

		<article class="structure">
			<h2>The structure - HTML</h2>
			<p>Before we add our colors or any images we need to create the structure of our site. For this we are going to use HTML. HTML is made up of keywords/tags that tell the browser how to interpret what you have written. For example you want to tell the browser that a piece of text is a heading. For a heading you would use one of 6 heading tags written as <xmp><h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6></xmp> When you load your file to the browser the browser will see these tags and know that these are heading tags therefore they will display them more prominently than a paragraph tag. There are many tags that will be used to describe the text on a page as well as the containers they sit in. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">HTML basics</a> I have written out the structure of our site so you can get firmilar with HTML tags by seeing them in action! Let's start with the basics and look at text.</p>
